In this lab, you'll claim your first Particle Mesh device, the Xenon, with the help of the Particle mobile app and an Ethernet FeatherWing. Once you've claimed your Xenon, you'll use [Tinker](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/tinker/photon/) on the Particle mobile app to interact with your new device.

## Before you start

1.  Create a new [Particle account](https://login.particle.io/signup)
2.  Install the Particle [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/particle-build-photon-electron/id991459054?ls=1&mt=8) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.particle.android.app) App

## Setting up a Xenon & Ethernet shield

1. Open your Xenon Kit. Remove the Xenon and micro-USB cable.

2. Remove the Ethernet FeatherWing from its box.

3. Insert the Xenon into the Ethernet FeatherWing. Make sure to align the headers so that the 12-pin side of the Xenon is inserted into the 12-pin header on the shield, and the 16-pin side of the Xenon is inserted into the 16-pin header on the FeatherWing.

4. Find an available Ethernet cable at your table and plug it into the Ethernet FeatherWing.

5. Take the micro-USB cable that came with your Xenon, plug the larger end into your laptop and the micro-USB connector into the Xenon. Once the Xenon powers up, it will automatically enter "[listening mode](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/modes/photon/#listening-mode)", which means its ready to be claimed.

## Claiming the Xenon from mobile

**Note**: Images below are from the iOS app. The flow of the Android setup experience is similar.

1.  Open the Particle Mobile App.

2.  Login, or create a new account if you don't already have one.

3.  On the "Your Devices" screen, click the "+" in the top-right to add a new device.

4.  Select the "Mesh" option and choose the "Xenon" option on the next screen.

![](./images/01/mobileadd.png)

5.  If you haven't done so already, plug your device into power using a USB cable. You can connect to a computer, though this is not required when using the mobile app.

Make sure your device is in "Listening Mode" (indicated by the RGB LED blinking blue). If the Xenon is not in listening mode, hold down the `MODE` button for three seconds, until the RGB LED begins blinking blue.

6. On the next screen, make sure to toggle the "Use with Ethernet?" switch and click the "Xenon is Blinking Blue" button.

6.  The next screen will instruct you to find the data matrix printed on your Xenon and scan it with your Phone's camera. Make sure to allow the app to access your camera to complete this step.

7. The app will now use Bluetooth to pair with your device so that it can be added to the Particle Device Cloud and associated with your account.

Congratulations, you've claimed your first Xenon. Now, you'll set up your first mesh network.

## Create a Mesh Network

1. Click "Continue onto Mesh Setup."

![](./images/01/joinMesh.png)

2. The app will scan for existing networks, and provide an option for creating a new network. Click on the "Create new network..." option.

![](./images/02/createNetwork.png)

3. Next, give your network a name. Try to give it a personalized name since there are going to be a lot of networks setup for this workshop.

![](./images/01/nameNetwork.png)

4. And set a password for your network.

![](./images/01/networkPassword.png)

5. Once your network is configured, your Xenon will be updated with the network information and configured as a gateway.

![](./images/01/configNetwork.png)

6. Finally, you'll be asked to give your new device a name.

![](./images/01/nameXenon.png)

7. Congrats, you've configured your first network. Click "I'm Done" and let's explore your new Mesh device with Tinker.

## Interacting with your Xenon with Tinker

Now that you've claimed your Xenon, it's time to light up an LED!

**Note**: images below are from the iOS app. The flow of the Android setup experience is similar.

1.  Open the Particle Mobile App.

![](./images/01/01-mobilesplash.png)

2.  Your new device should show up in the list with the name you gave it. If the Tinker firmware is still on the device, you'll see that indicated as well. If Tinker is not still on the device, you can flash it back onto the device using the Particle CLI with the command `particle flash <deviceName> tinker`.

Tap the device you want to interact with via Tinker.

![](./images/01/02-devicelist.png)

3.  When you select a device flashed with the Tinker firmware, you'll see a list of all the GPIO pins on the Xenon. With Tinker, you can control the digital and analog pins via reads and writes. If you have sensors or actuators connected to the Xenon, you can control them with Tinker.

![](./images/01/03-tinker.png)

4.  Every Xenon has a blue LED that's connected to pin D7, and you can use Tinker to control this LED. Tap on the circle marked "D7" and you'll see a pop-up that gives you two options, `digitalRead` and `digitalWrite`. Click on `digitalWrite`.

![](./images/01/04-d7.png)

5.  Once you select `digitalWrite` the pin button will be highlighted in red and show its current value. At first, this value will be digital `LOW` (or 0).

![](./images/01/05-d7low.png)

6.  Tap the button. You'll notice that it changed to `HIGH` (or 1).

![](./images/01/05-d7high.png)

7.  When the value changes to `HIGH`, you'll also notice that the blue light at D7 is on! Behind the scenes, Tinker is calling the `digitalWrite` and passing in either a `LOW` or `HIGH` value, which turns the LED off or on. Press the button again and you'll note that the LED turns back off.

![](./images/01/06-d7on.jpg)

Congratulations! You've claimed and named your first Xenon, and made it light up using the Tinker app. Now it's time to bring a second Xenon online and create your first Particle Mesh network!
