# About This Workshop
This workshop is sponsored by [Particle Industries](https:www.particle.io) and produced in cooperation with [Reflektor Consult](https://reflektor.dk). 

The workshop is a combination of a [presentations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ncoCRFaThkONZ8KvZKd5rBYi3dfptHsvo9mBVze_Pek) and the 4 hands-on sessions described in this guide.

> Elaborate description here

This workshop will take you through the basics of connecting a Particle Argon mesh device to the internet, and have it do amazing stuff. All in just 2 hours.

<!-- Previously
Particle workshops are half- and full-day hands on explorations of the Particle ecosystem, including hardware, firmware and software. Each workshop is led by Particle employees or community advocates, and are designed to give developers new to IoT development the hands-on training they need to confidently build their own IoT solutions, at home, work, and beyond!

The workshops are broken into presentations intermixed with hands-on labs that reinforce presentation content.

## FAQ

### Do I have to attend a workshop to complete the labs?
This site contains in-depth lab documents that complement in-person presentations delivered by [Reflektor](https://www.reflektor.dk). Attendance of a workshop isn't strictly required to follow along with these labs, but they are written under the assumption that you're attending a workshop and using workshop-provided hardware to complete the exercises.
