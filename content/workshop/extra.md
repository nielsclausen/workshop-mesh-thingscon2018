# Extras: Hacking on Mesh

## Ideas for taking your exploration further!

Now that you've gotten an overview of Mesh and the Particle Ecosystem, why not try building a web, mobile, or cloud app to interact with your Particle device? Here are a couple of ideas to get your started, and links to some resources you might find helpful.

1.  Create a Particle-powered mobile app using our [iOS](https://docs.particle.io/reference/ios/), [Android](https://docs.particle.io/reference/android/), and [Windows](https://docs.particle.io/reference/windows/) SDKs.

2.  Create a Particle-powered web app using the [Particle JS library](https://docs.particle.io/reference/javascript/) and your framework of choice, like [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/).

3.  Create a Particle-powered cross-platform mobile app using [NativeScript and Vue.js](https://www.nativescript.org/vue) and the [Particle NativeScript plugin](https://market.nativescript.org/plugins/nativescript-particle).

4.  Create an Azure IoT Hub Integration and [build dashboards with Electric IO](https://blog.particle.io/2018/09/28/create-the-dashboard-of-your-dreams-with-particle-electric-io/)

5.  [Apply to get a sneak peek at the new Particle Workbench](https://www.particle.io/workbench/apply/)

6.  [Request Access to the Particle Rules Engine Beta](https://www.particle.io/iot-rules-engine)
